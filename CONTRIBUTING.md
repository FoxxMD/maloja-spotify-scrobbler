# Creating a Pull Request

Please follow these guidelines when contributing code to this repository:

* The PR **must be for the [`develop` branch.](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/tree/develop)** The `master` branch is for releases only.
* Use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) format when creating commits.
* Preferably, please use a [feature branch](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39586780/1469797) instead of committing directly to `develop`.
* Ensure that if your code is covered by [an existing test](./src/backend/tests) that you have updated the test accordingly
