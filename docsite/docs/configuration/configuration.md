# Overview

[**Sources** and **Clients**](/#how-does-multi-scrobbler-ms-work) are configured using environmental (ENV) variables and/or json files.

**MS will parse configuration from both configuration types.** You can mix and match configurations but it is generally better to stick to one or the other.

TIP: Check the [**FAQ**](../FAQ.md) if you have any issues after configuration!

## ENV-Based Configuration

This is done by passing environmental variables and so does not require any files to run MS.

* Using a docker container EX `docker run -e "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=yourId" -e "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=yourSecret" ...`
* Using a local installations by exporting variables before running MS EX `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=yourId SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=yourSecret node index.js`

Use ENV-based configuration if:

* You are the only person for whom MS is scrobbling for
* You have a very simple setup for MS such as one scrobble [Client](/#client) and one [Source](/#source) IE Plex -> Maloja

## File-Based Configuration

MS will parse configuration files located in the directory specified by the `CONFIG_DIR` environmental variable. This variable defaults to:

* Local installation -> `PROJECT_DIR/config`
* Docker -> `/config` (in the container) -- see the [install docs](../installation/installation.md#docker) for how to configure this correctly

Use File-based configuration if:

* You have many [Sources](/#source)
* You have many of each type of **Source** you want to scrobble from IE 2x Plex accounts, 3x Spotify accounts, 1x
  Funkwhale...
* You have more than one scrobble **Client** you want to scrobble to IE multiple Maloja servers
* You want only some **Sources** to scrobble to some **Clients** IE Fred's Spotify account scrobbles to Fred's Maloja
    server, but not Mary's Maloja server

File-based configurations located in the `CONFIG_DIR` directory can be parsed from

* an **all-in-one** config file named `config.json` that contains information for all Sources and Clients and/or
* many **specific** files named based on the client/source to configure IE `plex.json` `spotify.json`

There are **example configurations** for all Source/Client types and AIO config located in the [/config](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/tree/master/config) directory of this project. These can be used as-is by renaming them to `.json`.
For docker installations these examples are copied to your configuration directory on first-time use.

There is also a [**kitchensink example**](kitchensink.md) that provides examples of using all sources/clients in a complex configuration.

### All-in-One File Configuration

[**Explore the schema for this configuration, along with an example generator and validator, here**](https://json-schema.app/view/%23?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Faio.json)

Example directory structure:

```
/CONFIG_DIR
  config.json
```

<details>
<summary>Config Example</summary>

```json5 title="config.json"
{
  //...
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "myConfig",
      "type": "spotify",
      "clients": [
        "myMalojaClient"
      ],
      "data": {
        "clientId": "anExample"
        //...
      }
    }
  ],
  "clients": [
    {
      "name": "myFirstMalojaClient",
      "type": "maloja",
      "data": {
        "url": "http://myMalojaServer.example",
        // ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

`config.json` can also be used to set default behavior for all sources/clients using `sourceDefaults` and `clientDefaults` properties.

See [config.json.example](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/config/config.json.example) for an annotated example or check out [the kitchen sink example](kitchensink.md).

### Specific File Configuration

Each file is named by the **type** of the Client/Source found in below sections. Each file as an **array** of that type of Client/Source.

Example directory structure:

```
/CONFIG_DIR
  plex.json
  spotify.json
  maloja.json
```

<details>
<summary>Config Example</summary>

```json5
// in maloja.json
[
  {
    "name": "myFirstMalojaClient",
    "data": {
      "url": "http://myMalojaServer.example",
      "apiKey": "myKey"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "mySecondMalojaClient",
    "data": {
      "url": "http://my2ndMalojaServer.example",
      "apiKey": "myKey"
    }
  }
]

```

</details>

See the [/config](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/config) directory of this project for examples of each type of config file or reference specific files below.

# Application Options

These options affect multi-scrobbler's behavior and are not specific to any source/client.

#### Base URL

Defines the URL that is used to generate default redirect URLs for authentication on [spotify](#spotify), [lastfm](#lastfm), and [deezer](#deezer) -- as well as some logging hints.

* Default => `http://localhost`
* Set with [ENV](#env-based-configuration) `BASE_URL` or `baseUrl` [all-in-one configuration](#all-in-one-file-configuration)

EX: Lastfm Redirect Url is `BASE_URL:PORT/lastfm/callback` -- Set `BASE_URL=http://192.168.0.101` => Redirect URL is `http://192.168.0.101:9078/lastfm/callback` (when no other redirectUri is specified for [lastfm configuration](#lastfm))

Useful when running with [docker](../installation/installation.md#docker) so that you do not need to specify redirect URLs for each configuration.

# Source Configurations

## [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)

To access your Spotify history you must [register an application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) to get a
Client ID/Secret. Make sure to also whitelist your redirect URI in the application settings.

**NOTE:** If your Spotify player has [Automix](https://community.spotify.com/t5/FAQs/What-is-Automix/ta-p/5257278) enabled and Spotify uses it for your playlist/queue then MS cannot accurately determine when a track will end. This is because the track is "mixed" in your queue with a shorter play time than its actual length and [Spotify does not report this modified play time in its API.](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/Wrong-duration-ms-of-track-with-Automix/m-p/5429147) This **does not affect MS's ability to scrobble** from Spotify but it will affect the accuracy of the duration MS reports was played.

### ENV-Based

## [Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org/)

Can use this source for any application that implements the [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) and supports the [`getNowPlaying`](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp#getNowPlaying) endpoint (such as [Airsonic](https://airsonic.github.io/) and [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/))

**Known Issues:**
* "Time played at" is somewhat inaccurate since the api only reports "played X minutes ago" so...
  * All scrobble times are therefore "on the minute" and you may experience occasional duplicate scrobbles
  * "played X minutes ago" sometimes is also not reported correctly
* Multiple artists are reported as one value and cannot be separated
* If using [Airsonic Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced) the password used (under **Credentials**) must be **Decodable**  

### ENV-Based

### File-Based

See [`jellyfin.json.example`](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/config/jellyfin.json.example) or [explore the schema with an example and live editor/validator](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FJellySourceConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Fsource.json)

## [Last.fm (Source)](https://www.last.fm)

See the [Last.fm (Client)](#lastfm) setup for registration instructions.

### ENV-Based

No support for ENV based for Last.fm as a client (only source)

### File-Based

See [`lastfm.json.example`](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/config/lastfm.json.example), change `configureAs` to `source`. Or [explore the schema with an example and live editor/validator](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FLastfmSourceConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Fsource.json)

## [Listenbrainz (Source)](https://listenbrainz.org)

You will need to run your own Listenbrainz server or have an account [on the official instance](https://listenbrainz.org/login/)

On your [profile page](https://listenbrainz.org/profile/) find your **User Token** to use in the configuration.

**NOTE:** You cannot use ENV variables shown in the [Listenbrainz Client config](#listenbrainz) -- multi-scrobbler assumes Listenbrainz ENVs are always used for the **client** configuration. You must use the file-based config from below to setup Listenbrainz as a Source.

### File-Based

See [`listenbrainz.json.example`](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/config/listenbrainz.json.example) or [explore the schema with an example and live editor/validator](https://json-schema.app/view/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FListenBrainzSourceConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Fsource.json)

**Change `configureAs` to `source`**

## [Deezer](https://deezer.com/)

Create a new application at [Deezer Developers](https://developers.deezer.com/myapps)

* Application Domain must be the same as your multi-scrobbler domain. Default is `localhost:9078`
* Redirect URL must end in `deezer/callback`
  * Default would be `http://localhost:9078/deezer/callback`

After application creation you should have credentials displayed in the "My Apps" dashboard. You will need:

* **Application ID**
* **Secret Key**
* **Redirect URL** (if not the default)

**If no access token is provided...**

After starting multi-scrobbler with credentials in-place open the dashboard (`http://localhost:9078`) and find your Deezer source. Click **(Re)authenticate and (re)start polling** to start the login process. After login is complete polling will begin automatically.

### ENV-Based

| Environmental Variable     | Required? | Default                                 |                    Description                     |
|----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `DEEZER_CLIENT_ID`        | Yes       |                                         |  Your **Application ID**                            |
| `DEEZER_CLIENT_SECRET`    | Yes       |                                         |  Your **Secret Key**                                |
| `DEEZER_REDIRECT_URI`     | No         | `http://localhost:9078/deezer/callback` | URI must end in `deezer/callback`         |

### File-Based

See [`deezer.json.example`](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/config/deezer.json.example) or [explore the schema with an example and live editor/validator](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FDeezerSourceConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Fsource.json)

## [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com)

Credentials for YT Music are obtained from a browser request to https://music.youtube.com **once you are logged in.** [Specific requirements are here and summarized below:](https://github.com/nickp10/youtube-music-ts-api/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#authenticate)

* Open a new tab
* Open the developer tools (Ctrl-Shift-I) and select the “Network” tab 
* Go to https://music.youtube.com and ensure you are logged in 

Then...

1. Find and select an authenticated POST request. The simplest way is to filter by /browse using the search bar of the developer tools. If you don’t see the request, try scrolling down a bit or clicking on the library button in the top bar.
2. **Make sure **Headers** pane is selected and open
3. In the **Request Headers** section find and copy the **entire value** found after `Cookie:` and use this as the `cookie` value in your multi-scrobbler config
4. If present, in the **Request Headers** section find and copy the number found in `X-google-AuthUser` and use this as the value for `authUser` in your multi-scrobbler config

![Google Headers](google-header.jpg)

NOTES:

* YT Music authentication is "browser based" which means your credentials may expire after a (long?) period of time OR if you log out of https://music.youtube.com. In the event this happens just repeat the steps above to get new credentials.
* Communication to YT Music is **unofficial** and not supported or endorsed by Google. This means that **this integration may stop working at any time** if Google decides to change how YT Music works in the browser.

### File-Based

See [`ytmusic.json.example`](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/config/ytmusic.json.example) or [explore the schema with an example and live editor/validator](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FYTMusicSourceConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Fsource.json)

## [MPRIS](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/)

MPRIS is a standard interface for communicating with Music Players on **linux operating systems.**

If you run Linux and have a notification tray that shows what media you are listening to, you likely have access to MPRIS.

![Notification Tray](mpris.jpg)

multi-scrobbler can listen to this interface and scrobble tracks played by **any media player** that communicates to the operating system with MPRIS.

**NOTE:** multi-scrobbler needs to be running as a [**Local Installation**](../installation/installation.md#local) in order to use MPRIS. This cannot be used from docker.

### ENV-Based

| Environmental Variable | Required? | Default | Description                                                                      |
|------------------------|-----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MPRIS_ENABLE           | No        |         | Use MPRIS as a Source (useful when you don't need any other options)             |
| MPRIS_BLACKLIST        | No        |         | Comma-delimited list of player names not to scrobble from                        |
| MPRIS_WHITELIST        | No        |         | Comma-delimited list of players names to ONLY scrobble from. Overrides blacklist |

## [Mopidy](https://mopidy.com/)

Mopidy is a headless music server that supports playing music from many [standard and non-standard sources such as Pandora, Bandcamp, and Tunein.](https://mopidy.com/ext/)

multi-scrobbler can scrobble tracks played from any Mopidy backend source, regardless of where you listen to them.

### File-Based

See [`mopidy.json.example`](https://github.com/FoxxMD/multi-scrobbler/blob/master/config/mopidy.json.example) or [explore the schema with an example and live editor/validator](https://json-schema.app/view/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FMopidySourceConfig/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FMopidyData?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Fsource.json)

Configuration Options:

##### `url`

The URL used to connect to the Mopidy server. You MUST have [Mopidy-HTTP extension](https://mopidy.com/ext/http) enabled.

If no `url` is provided a default is used which assumes Mopidy is installed on the same server as multi-scrobbler: `ws://localhost:6680/mopidy/ws/`

Make sure the hostname and port number match what is found in the Mopidy configuration file `mopidy.conf`:

```
...

[http]
hostname = localhost
port = 6680

...
```

The URL used to connect ultimately must be formed like this: `[protocol]://[hostname]:[port]/[path]`
If any part of this URL is missing multi-scrobbler will use a default value, for your convenience. This also means that if any part of your URL is **not** standard you must explicitly define it.

Part => Default Value

* Protocol => `ws://`
* Hostname => `localhost`
* Port => `6680`
* Path => `/mopidy/ws/`

#### URI Blacklist/Whitelist

If you wish to disallow or only allow scrobbling from some sources played through Mopidy you can specify these using `uriBlacklist` or `uriWhitelist` in your config. multi-scrobbler will check the list to see if any string matches the START of the `uri` on a track. If whitelist is used then blacklist is ignored. All strings are case-insensitive.

EX:

```json
{
  "uriBlacklist": ["soundcloud"]
}
```

Will prevent multi-scrobbler from scrobbling any Mopidy track that start with a `uri` like `soundcloud:song:MySong-1234`

#### Album Blacklist

For certain sources (Soundcloud) Mopidy does not have all track info (Album) and will instead use "Soundcloud" as the Album name. You can prevent multi-scrobbler from using this bad Album data by adding the fake Album name to this list. Multi-scrobbler will still scrobble the track, just without the bad data. All strings are case-insensitive.

EX:

```json
{
  "albumBlacklist": ["SoundCloud", "Mixcloud"]
}
```

If a track would be scrobbled like `Album: Soundcloud, Track: My Cool Track, Artist: A Cool Artist` 
then multi-scrobbler will instead scrobble  `Track: My Cool Track, Artist: A Cool Artist`

## [JRiver](https://jriver.com/)

In order for multi-scrobbler to communicate with JRiver you must have [Web Server Interface](https://wiki.jriver.com/index.php/Web_Service_Interface#Documentation_of_Functions) enabled. This can can be in the JRiver GUI:

* Tools -> Options -> Media Network
  * Check `Use Media Network to share this library...`
  * If you have `Authentication` checked you will need to provide the **Username** and **Password** in the ENV/File configuration below.

#### URL

If you do not provide a URL then a default is used which assumes JRiver is installed on the same server as multi-scrobbler: `http://localhost:52199/MCWS/v1/`

* Make sure the port number matches what is found in `Advanced` section in the [Media Network](#jriver) options.
* If your installation is on the same machine but you cannot connect using `localhost` try `0.0.0.0` instead.

The URL used to connect ultimately must be formed like this: `[protocol]://[hostname]:[port]/[path]`
If any part of this URL is missing multi-scrobbler will use a default value, for your convenience. This also means that if any part of your URL is **not** standard you must explicitly define it.

Part => Default Value

* Protocol => `http://`
* Hostname => `localhost`
* Port => `52199`
* Path => `/MCWS/v1/`

## [WebScrobbler](https://web-scrobbler.com/)

After installing the extension open the preferences/settings for it:

* Under **Accounts**
  * **Add Webhook**
    * API URL: `http://localhost:9078/api/webscrobbler`
    * Application name: `(whatever you want)`

Reload the extension after adding the webhook.

* **On Firefox** - Only FQNs (domain.tld), `localhost`, and `127.0.0.1` are supported for API URL due to [firefox requiring https](https://github.com/web-scrobbler/web-scrobbler/issues/4183#issuecomment-1749222006)
* **On Chromium-based Browsers** - Any domain will work for API URL
* All Other browsers are untested

#### Multiple Users

If you would like use multiple WebScrobbler sources they can be matched using a **slug** at the end of the **API URL.** This requires using [a file-based config.](#file-based-configuration)

Example:

In `webscrobbler.json`

```json
[
  {
    "name": "aUserWS",
    "clients": [
      "client1Maloja"
    ],
    "data": {
      "slug": "usera" 
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "bUserWS",
    "clients": [
      "client2Maloja"
    ],
    "data": {
      "slug": "userb"
    }
  }
]
```

* To use `aUserWS` source set **API URL** to `http://localhost:9078/api/webscrobbler/usera`
* To use `bUserWS` source set **API URL** to `http://localhost:9078/api/webscrobbler/userb`

Note: `http://localhost:9078/api/webscrobbler` is matched with the first source that _that does not have a slug defined._

##### Connectors Black/Whitelist

MS can be configured to only scrobble, or NOT scrobble, from some WS connectors. Use the name of the website from the [supported websites](https://web-scrobbler.com/) or from the **Connectors** tab in the extension. Note that this **only** affects MS's behavior and does not affect the general connector behavior you have configured within the WebScrobbler extension.

## [Google Cast (Chromecast)](https://www.google.com/chromecast/built-in/)

**NOTE:** Google Cast support is **experimental**. You may experience crashes and errors while using this Source. Please open an issue if you experience problems and include all information detailed in the issue template to help debug your issue.

If your media device can be **Cast** to using this button ![Chromecast Icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Chromecast_cast_button_icon.svg) on your phone/computer then multi-scrobbler can monitor it in order to scrobble music you play.

**Note:** This source relies on common, **basic** music data provided by the cast device which will always be less exhaustive than data parsed from full source integrations. If there is an existing [Source](#source-configurations) it is recommended to configure for it and blacklist the app on Google Cast, rather than relying solely on Google Cast for scrobbling.

### Connecting Devices

Cast devices can be manually configured using [File-based configuration](#file-based-14) OR automatically discovered using **mDNS.**

##### mDNS Discovery

The host machine running multi-scrobbler must be configured to allow [mDNS traffic on port 5353/UDP](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/5353-udp-multicast-dns-mdns).

##### Linux

**Docker**

The host machine must have [avahi-daemon](https://avahi.org/) running to circumvent limitations with DNS resolution due to musl in Alpine. Most major linux distributions package avahi and many have it built-in. Once avahi is running you must pass D-Bus and the avahi daemon socket to your container like so:

```
docker run ... -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus -v  	/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket:/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket ... foxxmd/multi-scrobbler
```

**Flatpak/Nodejs**

No additional steps are required.

##### Windows

**Docker**

Unsupported at this time.

**Nodejs**

No additional steps are required.

### What Media Does MS Scrobble?

Cast devices report what type of media the current activity is [(see `metadata` property here)](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media/messages#MediaInformation). The reported type is dependent on the application playing the media to correctly report it, the cast device does not magically know what the media is. If an application does not report a type it is always classified as `unknown`.

**By default, MS will only track media that is reported as `MusicTrack`.**

#### Allow Unknown Media Type

Media with an Unknown (`Generic`) media type can be explicitly allowed by setting `"allowUnknownMedia": true` in the [file-based configuration.](#file-based-14) This can also be configured to only allow unknown media types for specific applications by using a list of application names like:

```json5
// in chromecast.json or config.json sources
[
  {
    "name": "MyCast",
    "type": "chromecast",
    "data": {
      // only allow unknown if app name contains any of these phrases
      "allowUnknownMedia": ["smarttube", "default media receiver"]
    },
  }
]
```

#### Forcing Media Tracking

MS can be forced to track media from an application regardless of media type. This is useful if an application incorrectly reports a media type you are sure should be music. Set `"forceMediaRecognitionOn"` in the [file-based configuration.](#file-based-14) to a list of application names that should always be tracked like:

```json5
// in chromecast.json or config.json sources
[
  {
    "name": "MyCast",
    "type": "chromecast",
    "data": {
      // media from applications that contains these phrases will always be tracked, regardless of media type reported
      "forceMediaRecognitionOn": ["smarttube", "default media receiver"]
    },
  }
]
```


### Cast Troubleshooting

Please include any/all logs with raw output if there are any errors encountered as this is critical to diagnosing issues.

To diagnose bad/incomplete track information or strange MS player behavior please turn on **payload logging** and include log output of the source running to help diagnose this issue:

```json5
// in chromecast.json or config.json sources
[
  {
    "name": "MyCast",
    "type": "chromecast",
    "data": {
      //...
    },
    "options": {
      "logPayload": true
    }
  }
]
```

# Monitoring

multi-scrobbler supports some common webhooks and a healthcheck endpoint in order to monitor Sources and Clients for errors.

## Webhook Configurations

Webhooks will **push** a notification to your configured servers on these events:

* Source polling started 
* Source polling retry
* Source polling stopped on error 
* Scrobble client scrobble failure

Webhooks are configured in the main [config.json](#all-in-one-file-configuration) file under the `webhook` top-level property. Multiple webhooks may be configured for each webhook type. EX:

```json5
{
  "sources": [
    //...
  ],
  "clients": [
    //...
  ],
  "webhooks": [
    {
      "name": "FirstGotifyServer",
      "type": "gotify",
      "url": "http://192.168.0.100:8070",
      "token": "abcd"
    }, 
    {
      "name": "SecondGotifyServer",
      "type": "gotify",
      //...
    },
    {
      "name": "NtfyServerOne",
      "type": "ntfy",
      //...
    },
    //...
  ]
}
```

### [Gotify](https://gotify.net/)

Refer to the [config schema for GotifyConfig](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FGotifyConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Faio.json)

multi-scrobbler optionally supports setting message notification priority via `info` `warn` and `error` mappings.

EX

```json
{
  "type": "gotify",
  "name": "MyGotifyFriendlyNameForLogs",
  "url": "http://192.168.0.100:8070",
  "token": "AQZI58fA.rfSZbm",
  "priorities": {
    "info": 5,
    "warn": 7,
    "error": 10
  }
}
```

### [Ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/)

Refer to the [config schema for NtfyConfig](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FNtfyConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbackend%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Faio.json)

multi-scrobbler optionally supports setting message notification priority via `info` `warn` and `error` mappings.

EX

```json
{
  "type": "ntfy",
  "name": "MyNtfyFriendlyNameForLogs",
  "url": "http://192.168.0.100:9991",
  "topic": "RvOwKJ1XtIVMXGLR",
  "username": "Optional",
  "password": "Optional",
  "priorities": {
    "info": 3,
    "warn": 4,
    "error": 5
  }
}
```

## Health Endpoint

An endpoint for monitoring the health of sources/clients is available at GET `http://YourMultiScrobblerDomain/health`

* Returns `200 OK` when **everything** is working or `500 Internal Server Error` if **anything** is not 
* The plain url (`/health`) aggregates status of **all clients/sources** -- so any failing client/source will make status return 500 
  * Use query params `type` or `name` to restrict client/sources aggregated IE `/health?type=spotify` or `/health?name=MyMaloja`
* On 500 the response returns a JSON payload with `messages` array that describes any issues
  * For any clients/sources that require authentication `/health` will return 500 if they are **not authenticated** 
  * For sources that poll (spotify, yt music, subsonic) `/health` will 500 if they are **not polling**
